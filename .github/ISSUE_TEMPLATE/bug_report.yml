        If you only see the standard help menu (as shown below), then you are probably running v1.1.10 or below. Upgrade to NVM4W 1.1.11+.

        ```sh
        Running version 1.1.11.
        
        Usage:
        
          nvm arch                     : Show if node is running in 32 or 64 bit mode.
          nvm current                  : Display active version.
          nvm debug                    : Check the NVM4W process for known problems (troubleshooter).
          nvm install <version> [arch] : The version can be a specific version, "latest" for the latest current version, or "lts" for the
                                         most recent LTS version. Optionally specify whether to install the 32 or 64 bit version (defaults
                                         to system arch). Set [arch] to "all" to install 32 AND 64 bit versions.
                                         Add --insecure to the end of this command to bypass SSL validation of the remote download server.
          nvm list [available]         : List the node.js installations. Type "available" at the end to see what can be installed. Aliased as ls.
          nvm off                      : Enable node.js version management.
          nvm off                      : Disable node.js version management.
